  * Right now all curl output is redirected to /dev/null because the output is a bit ugly.  
  * Need to check for errors and translate them to human-firendly text.
  * Would also be nice to have a confirmation of success.
* Make phonebook lookups case-insensitive?
* Have better handling of quotes in message text?
